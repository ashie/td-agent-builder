# toolbelt/*.sh Introduction

This directory is created to archive original installation scripts
which are hosted on toolbelt.treasuredata.com.

These installation script was dynamically generated on
https://toolbelt.treasuredata.com and source code was hosted on
TreasureData's private repository.

It rely on deploying commercial cloud service and if we lost access to
that private repository, can't manage them anymore. As a workaround,
support to generate similar install script and upload it as static
file. make-install-script.rb now supports to generate static version
of installation script, but to confirm compatibility some extent,
original installation scripts should be archived to make it comparable
with them.
